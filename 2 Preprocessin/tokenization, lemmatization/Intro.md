# Tokenization and Lemmatization in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
# Introduction
In the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), we often deal with large amounts of text data. To make sense of this data, we need to break it down into smaller parts and understand the meaning of each word. This is where tokenization and lemmatization come into play.

## What is Tokenization?
Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, called tokens. These tokens could be words, phrases, or even individual characters, depending on the level of granularity we need for our analysis.

## What is Lemmatization?
Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or root form, called a lemma. This helps in normalizing different forms of the same word, making it easier to analyze and understand the text.

Examples
Let's understand tokenization and lemmatization with some examples:

Tokenization Example:
Consider the following sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

After tokenization, this sentence would be broken down into individual words or tokens:

The
quick
brown
fox
jumps
over
the
lazy
dog
Lemmatization Example:
Now, let's lemmatize the same sentence. Lemmatization aims to reduce words to their base form:

"The" -> "the"
"quick" -> "quick"
"brown" -> "brown"
"fox" -> "fox"
"jumps" -> "jump"
"over" -> "over"
"the" -> "the"
"lazy" -> "lazy"
"dog" -> "dog"
As you can see, words like "jumps" and "dog" are reduced to their base forms ("jump" and "dog", respectively).
